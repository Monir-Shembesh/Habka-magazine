Habka magazine is a Libyan magazine targeted towards youth and publishing manga/comics. This application was soley built in 1 month and released on both android and IOS

**Usage**
Due to certain circumstances, only the application code (Swift language) is available for use. The art and graphics is under a different license and thus could not be open publicly. I am currently in the process of making everything else available publicly.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

**License**

**Project status**
The magazine currently is undergoing changes and looking for funding, thus, the development was paused and will be resumed accordingly.
